Math Refresher--as close as I've come to JavaScript
totally decoupled from the HTML document; classed elements can be added,
rearranged, & removed without script failure.   

The page creates three kinds of 
randomly generated arithmetic problems--4th grade level*--
validates user input, and displays correct answers
for incorrect responses.

*It was my daughter's idea.
